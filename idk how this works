'''
Casino War Threading Game in Python
Created by: Kyle Guieb & Daniel Quintana Menjivar
version 0.1a

We opted for an object-oriented approach and ease of flexibility
for designing our project. Python's OpenMP-like threading support is
used.

-TODO-
TODO: Rank cards (2 lowest card, 10 is highest number, then Jack, Queen King, Ace is the highest card)
TODO: Create the player: They have a (randomized) money amount, and a current card
TODO: Create the dealer: They only have a current card
TODO: Playing the game:
The player will have a amount of money to bet, they will bet a random amount of money
Immediately, the bet will be subtracted from their money count (Keep how much they bet)
One by one? The dealer will compare their card with the player (or the other way around, whichever is easier to implement)
If they win, they will add the amount they bet times 2 (player.money = bet*2)
If they lose, they will add 0 to their money pile (or maybe just nothing happens cause it's already gone)
if there is a tie:
Randomly choose: Forfeit half or go to war
If forfeit half: add amount they bet * (1/2) back to their money count
If war: minus same bet amount from player, deal new cards to player & dealer, play as normal, if tie, player wins
Once a round finishes, check player money count, if < 1, remove player, otherwise repeat the game, until 30 rounds
